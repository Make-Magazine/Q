# Q

If you have a web task, getting it in the Web Queue, (henceforth known as the Q) is a simple task. 

From the project description, Q is the home of the web development tasks for all Maker Media-related websites. All assignments will be assigned by the Web Team. Please add all new tasks to Awaiting Assignment. Once they have been added there, they will be assigned to the appropriate developer, and then move into the appropriate section of the Q.  

Always include: Due date, all required assets (images, links, layout PSDs/screenshots), and subtasks (when relevant).

If you need something launched at a specific time of day, detail that at the top of the task description.

The new feature, and my reason for writing all of you lovely people today is that we have a few new priority headings for tasks.

## Priority Headings

### Priority 1 - Urgent Priority

Tasks that are set to this status are of the highest priority, and the system is practically unusable with this defect. The defect will have either business losses or data loss. There is no reasonable workaround. Someone could even die. _(Really don't want to be responsible for something along these linesâ€¦)_ __Basically, must be done now__

### Priority 2 - High Priority

Loss of functionality with a reasonable workaround. While a bug, or task may exist, there is something that can be done in the mean time to workaround it. If there is something time sensitive, it would be a high priority, and the expectation would be that a fix goes out in the next 24 or so hours. __Must be done soon__

### Priority 3 - Normal Priority

This is for tasks that need to be done at a normal pace, fit in where they can be. The task is a minor annoyance (Doesn't prevent the user from exercising the functionality) __Needs to be done__

### Priority 4 - Low Priority

For tasks that are future efforts, or a cosmetic error and should be fixed as time and resources allow. __To be done when time and resources allow__
